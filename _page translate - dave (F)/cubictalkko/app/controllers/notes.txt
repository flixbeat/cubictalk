sir, these are just samples of controller that has translate page (Lessons,Payments,Teachers)



every controller needs to add 'LanguageHandler' component
$var components = array('LanguageHandler');



in the controller's function, we need to add 2 lines of code

ex:

function index(){
	$language = $this->LanguageHandler->set_lang();
	$this->set('language',$language);
}
